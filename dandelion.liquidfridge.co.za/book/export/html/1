<p>2015: <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html#article" rel="nofollow">The world of the electron and the switch</a>. A vast ocean of knowledge and collaboration at our fingertips. The beauty of the baud. With access to the Internet, humanity is no longer limited to geographic location. Our communications network has great potential for facilitating social change on one hand and control on the other. How do we prevent ourselves from giving in to the lesser angels of our nature?</p>

<h2>Hello, world!</h2>

<p>On these pages we are fleshing out a modest concept combining meaningful dialogue, offline and online communities, and civic engagement. The working title: <em>Dandelion</em>. Think of it as a book club, but for discussions about society, economics, politics, technology, and the natural environment. In the parlance of bygone times, a salon. One that espouses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic" rel="nofollow">hacker ethic</a>, and encourages following up talk with action.</p>

<p>In telecommunication terminology, a network is as an interconnected set of nodes that exchange information. A node is the most basic part of a network; for example, a user or a computer. These nodes can be organised in various ways, and this organisation is what distinguishes different types of network architecture from each other.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_56xn4g8" title="http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/resources/articles/what-is-a-federated-network/" href="http://dandelion.liquidfridge.co.za/#footnote1_56xn4g8">1</a></p>

We aim to avoid centralised, top-down bureaucracy in favour of independence, sharing, and occasional collaboration between clubs. Clubs are self-governed, self-reliant, and free to organise and brand their activities as they wish. We only ask that they abide by our principles. In return, we provide guidance to organisers, and an opportunity to tap into a network of like-minds and social game changers.</p>

<p>A discussion club can be a circle of friends or a crowd of strangers. These people can come from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and have different norms and values. They might not want to, and don't have to, refer to themselves as a "club." "Picnic" or "society" might be more appealing terms.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Productive dialogue is about learning. We recommend running small, informal events that resemble an unconference. 15 people or less. Here's why:</p>

<ul><li>It's easier to make connections and have real conversations in a small group.</li>
	<li>Attendees that want to, can speak up more easily.</li>
	<li>To keep financial cost to a minimum. This lessens the burden on organisers and lowers the barrier to participation for attendees.</li>
	<li>To lessen the psychological cost for organisers. Organising events with high production values is stressful. The less stress is involved, the more likely an event will happen again.</li>
</ul><p>The format of the event depends on the topic of discussion and the resources available to the organisers. Possible formats include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Group discussion:</strong> The club picks a topic, compiles a reading list, researches, and a few weeks later, forms an interesting discussion around it.</li>
	<li><strong>Show and tell:</strong> Attendees bring their work-in-progress passion projects or demos to show and tell; perhaps with a theme. This is the springboard for conversations.</li>
	<li><strong>Expert lecture:</strong> A talk by an activist, academic or a researcher with a well-developed idea, e.g. a podcast, a book in progress, or a manifesto. An audience of more than 10 people would likely be more appropriate for this.</li>
	<li><strong>P2P:</strong> Two groups link up via the web for a shared discussion or expert lecture.</li>
</ul><h2>Online</h2>

<p>We recommend that each club should have a blog for sharing content with their community. This blog could be updated frequently or only prior to an event, with a reading list. Discussions should be documented, so that follow-up is easy for both attendees and outsiders, and so that ideas can spread through the network. This could be in audio or video, for example a podcast or a YouTube video. Ideally, a transcript should be available for reading, for accessing any websites that were mentioned, to improve accessibility for non-native speakers and hearing-impaired people, and for indexing by search engines.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">@todo The following will probably be divided between this page, Get Started, Resources:</span></p>

<ul><li>List examples of blog solutions, e.g. WordPress, wikis, etc. Briefly describe the differences in tech and capacity needs.</li>
	<li>List examples of discussion boards and mailing lists, e.g. Discourse, Google Groups, etc. Briefly describe the differences in tech and capacity needs, e.g. community manager for large groups.</li>
	<li>List examples of chat solutions, e.g. Twitter, Slack, IRC, etc. Briefly describe the differences in tech and capacity needs.</li>
	<li>Describe how to archive chats and prevent ideas from getting lost (summarised in blog post after event?)</li>
	<li>Describe how the main website works, and how content will be aggregated on the main website and shared between clubs. Include API-, metadata- and microformat-related issues.</li>
	<li>Describe pros and cons of hosting discussion on central domain using something like subreddits vs. hosting discussions on individual group's site.</li>
</ul><h2>Topics</h2>

<p>Topics could range from the heavier politics of technology and power, to the lighter politics of dancing. We encourage civic engagement, and so, recommend that discussions should aim for a problem-solving angle where possible. Generally, discussions could be about:</p>

<ul><li>Broad themes and specific issues affecting the local and/or global community, e.g. social, economic, political, technological, ecological, or a combination thereof.</li>
	<li>How community organisations, e.g. activists or volunteers, are addressing those issues.</li>
</ul><h2>Promotion</h2>

<p><span class="highlight">@todo Describe how the concept can be spread via youth leadership and social entrepreneurship programmes, community media (e.g. partnership with radio), etc.</span></p>

<p>Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Elizabeth again: The whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing on the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving that little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. It takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you altogether. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole ship of state is going to turn around.</p>

<p>So I said, "Call me Trim Tab." —R. Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>"My definition of art has always been the same. It is about freedom of expression, a new way of communication. It is never about exhibiting in museums or about hanging it on the wall. Art should live in the heart of the people. Ordinary people should have the same ability to understand art as anybody else. I don't think art is elite or mysterious. I don't think anybody can separate art from politics. The intention to separate art from politics is itself a very political intention. I definitely know people who are shameless enough to give up basic values. I see this kind of art, and when I see it I feel ashamed. In China they treat art as some form of decoration, a self-indulgence. It is pretending to be art. It looks like art. It sells like art. But it is really a piece of shit." —Ai Weiwei (2011)<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_r46kxh6" title="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ai-weiwei-shame-on-me-a-799302-2.html" href="http://dandelion.liquidfridge.co.za/#footnote1_r46kxh6">1</a></p>
